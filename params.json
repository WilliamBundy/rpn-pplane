All positive and negative real numbers work, anything else gets treated as not-a-number (`NaN`).\r\n\r\n### Variables\r\nThe only defined variables are `x` and `y`. Constructs such as `2x` are not allowed, use `2 x *`. \r\n\r\n### Defined Functions:\r\n- Addition: `+`\r\n- Subtraction: `-`\r\n- Multiplication: `*`\r\n- Division: `/`\r\n- Powers: `^`\r\n\r\n- Square Root: `sqrt`\r\n- Sine: `sin`\r\n- Cosine: `cos`\r\n- Tangent: `tan`\r\n- Natural Logarithm: `log`\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
